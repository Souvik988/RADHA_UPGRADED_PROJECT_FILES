 * That write is owned by `BE-10 / BE-11` (`ProductsRepository.upsert`)
 * — which BE-11 v2 will surface as a higher-level service. To keep
 * BE-56 testable and decoupled until then, we depend on a tiny
 * port the BE-11 wiring step rebinds in production.
 *
 * The default binding is the `StubProductsCatalogAdapter` below: it
 * logs the would-be upsert and returns a deterministic synthetic id.
 * Tests inject their own implementation; the real adapter ships
 * alongside BE-11 v2's catalog service.
