/**
 * BE-30 — Real-time KPI aggregation for a single store.
 *
 * Each KPI section runs as a single dependent SQL with denormalised
 * counters and partial counts. All five sections execute in parallel
 * to stay inside the 1-second budget on a hot connection.
 *
 * Every query is store-scoped on its primary index, and every read
 * filters out soft-deleted rows. The dashboard is read-only — there
 * are no writes here, only reads.
 *
 * Tables touched:
 *   - `scan_items`       (BE-16)
 *   - `expiry_records`   (BE-18)
 *   - `tasks`            (BE-19)
 *   - inventory totals   — read from `products` until BE-27 ships
 *                          its inventory_items query, at which
 *                          point this method takes the BE-27
 *                          provider as well.
